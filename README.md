# Newspaper-Agency-Automation-Software

The local newspaper and magazine delivery agency has asked ups to develop a software for him to automate various clerical activites associated with his business.

•  This software is to be used by the manager of the news agency and his delivery persons.

•  For each delivery person, the system must print each day the publications to be delivered to each address. The addresses should be generated in consecutive order as far as possible so that the commutation of the delivery person is minimal.
